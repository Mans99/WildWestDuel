This is a project for the course advanced interaction design. It is an android application which puts the user in a Wild west duel. Using the phone as the gun this application will put your reactions to the test.

The application utilises the accelerometor in order to detect when a shot should be fired. A firebase database enables PvP matches to happen. This repository is a copy of the original and is only used to display the project.
